# Each new version of the mod, and each version developed by each contributor, should be placed in its own branch.

# Example: A branch hierarchy for two developers for v1.0.0

main
	v1.0.0
		User1

# After the branch is published and finished, contributors can collaborate to decide which updates need to be pushed to higher level branches.
