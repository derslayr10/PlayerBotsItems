# Using following naming standard for all version/patch versions:

vX.Y.Z

# Breakdown:
- Always list the version starting with a "v" for the purposes of read-only documents that are not code related.
	-Example documents include the Read-Me and Changelog

- X is used to denote MAJOR updates, such as implementing new whole features or rewrites of mod data.

- Y is used to denote MINOR updates, such as adding new items or minor features. May also be used to denote large bug fixes.

- Z is used to denote PATCH updates, such as fixing minor bugs that would otherwise not interrupt normal gameplay.

# Example of naming system: TwistedLoopMod v2.1.0
